            Alright on to step seven. Before I explain this step though, i have a question.
            Are you really trying to learn how to tie a tie? Well I gotta be honest with you 
            champ, this ain't the best place to try and actually do that. If you haven't been 
            able to tell, I haven't been giving the best directions as of how to actually tie 
            a tie. Mr. Sweeney <strong>did </strong>say after all that we don't really need to 
            add specific text. Instead of learning, you get to experience my 10PM commentary. How fun!

            You know, I was going to put a quote with something motivational here, but I decided 
            to delete it. You want to know why, because I wanted to. I made this decision and there's 
            nothing you can do about it. Sure, you could go into inpsect element and change anything 
            here to your heart's desire, but that doesn't change the fact that <strong>I </strong>
            created what you're looking at right now. How does it feel to not have power over this situation?
            are you scared? Angry? However you're feeling, I don't care. After all, text boxes can't have 
            feelings. We just display whatever God wants us to say. This of us as a text from a higher power.
            Or an omninous billboard you think you recognize while driving to work on the highway.

            Well you've made it this far, and I congratulate you. Personally I would have tabbed out after like 
            step five when I realized there wasn't actually anything helpful on this website. But no. You persevered 
            through the emptiness of this website. You took the time to <a href="https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/041/494/1241026091_youve_been_rickrolled.gif" target="_blank">Click Here</a>
            sit down and read what I had to say. Yet I wonder, why'd you do it? Are you looking through relics of 
            the past? Am I me from the futute looking back and wondering what I was thinking by putting all of this here? 
            Do I finally have a beard? But if we're being honest it's probably just Mr. Sweeney grading my work and maybe 
            annoyed that he clicked the link. What should he have expected though, who wouldn't want to click that link? 
            It literally says "Click Here". Who could resist? Anyways, I'm going on a tangent. Thanks for being here through
            this journey :)
