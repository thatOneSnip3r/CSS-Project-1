            So you want to know how to Tie a Tie? Well if you're looking
            at this website you probably go to US, so why should you need a
            guide? Regardless, this website will teach you how to do a simple
            half-windsor knot. Let's begin! Use the navigation bar above to switch

            Alright so first, you wanna put the tie around your neck with the wide 
            end on the right and the skinny end on the left. Make sure that the skinny
            end is shorter than the wide end though, as it's vital to getting a good final product.

    <div class="step-2">

        <p>
            Next, you want to cross the wide end over the skinny end. Still make sure that the
            lengths of the two sides haven't changed. It's <strong>VITAL </strong> they're different
            lengths.

        <p>
            Now, you wanna move the wide end behind the skinny end. Honestly, at this point you can 
            really just look at the picture I put so neatly above. They're just for you! I'm just here 
            for commentary at this point. Don't mind me.
