            Wait we're already on step four? Dang, time has flown by fast! Well as
            long as you keep reading these steps everything should go fine. If you
            mess up at the end, it's your fault. Not mine :) I'm just a text box afterall.

            There once was a man from Peru, who dreamed he was eating his shoe. He woke with
             a fright, in the middle of the night, to find that his dream had come true. This quote 
             here is from S1E15 of Spongebob Squarepants. I don't know why I chose this quote, it just
             came to me in the moment.

            What do you think of the Corgis in the background? Originally I was going to use a rainbow
            effect, but it didn't really match up with the background. Images double the more you widen
            the page so it just looked messy. Luckily <a href="https://www.corgiorgy.com/" target="_blank">
            this website here</a> (that I won't name for obvious reasons) came into my memory as one of the 
            three gifs I know by heart. Clutch!
